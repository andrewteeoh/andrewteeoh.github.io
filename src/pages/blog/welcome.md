Welcome to my site! Heck, this is as far as I've gotten on _any_ personal site that I've started in the past.

## Goals

My primary goal with this is to write more. When I was a manager and tech lead tasked with writing design, decision, and proposal documents, I discovered that I really enjoy writing. If I set enough time aside to do it, I started to feel that all the thoughts and ideas I had jumbled in my head became clearer and more organized.

The secondary goal of this blog is to serve as a place where I can share projects and things I've learned. All too often I've learned something I knew was important, only to forget about it after less tan a week. My hope is that this will also serve as a reference for the things I've told myself I care about

## Thanks

For making it this far and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
